    "text": "This machine learning (ML) analysis focuses on Reddit discussions about U.S. states, aiming to uncover patterns and categorize conversations. Using advanced unsupervised learning techniques like Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), we identify the dominant themes and visualize their distribution geographically. Each section dives into one aspect of state discussions, contributing to a broader understanding of state-based dynamics on Reddit. The data source for this analysis was the subreddit data\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing LDA, Reddit discussions were categorized into four primary topics:\n\nTourism and Travel\nPolitics and Governance\nLifestyle and Culture\nEconomy and Business\n\nThe most common topic for each state was identified and visualized on the interactive map below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStates like Florida, Nevada, and Hawaii prominently feature travel-related discussions.\nThese discussions are likely tied to vacation planning, major tourist attractions, and seasonal trends.\n\nTakeaway: Travel topics reflect Reddit’s role in sharing experiences and discussing popular destinations with strong tourism appeal.\n\n\n\n\n\nStates like Montana, Washington, Arizona, and Michigan dominate political discussions.\nThese states likely feature political conversations tied to regional issues, legislative matters, and elections.\n\nTakeaway: Political topics highlight regional political activity and Reddit’s ability to surface diverse political conversations.\n\n\n\n\n\nStates like New York and Louisiana lead in discussions about lifestyle and culture.\nThese states are recognized for their unique traditions, festivals, food, and cultural diversity.\n\nTakeaway: Discussions about lifestyle and culture reflect the importance of local traditions and regional identity in state-focused conversations.\n\n\n\n\n\nStates like California and Texas dominate commerce-related discussions.\nThese discussions center around industries, employment opportunities, and economic trends in these major business hubs.\n\nTakeaway: Economic topics highlight Reddit’s relevance in tracking business activity and labor market dynamics in key economic states.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is one of many analyses that explore Reddit discussions about U.S. states. Together with other insights, such as temporal trends, sentiment analysis, and subreddit-level dynamics, these findings provide a multifaceted view of online state discussions.\n\n\n\nFurther exploration could involve:\n\nTemporal Trends: How do discussions about topics like tourism and politics evolve over time?\nEngagement Analysis: Which topics drive the most interactions (upvotes and comments) on Reddit?\nSubreddit Activity: How do specific subreddits amplify or shape state discussions?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing different spark regression models, the goal was to see if we could determine the score of a post (the total of likes minus the total of dislikes) using the text of the post itself and whether a state is mentioned or not. The goal of this was to determine if the presence of certain states were able to predict the score of a post, which is a stand in for the popularity.\n\n\n\nBoth a linear regression and random forest model were applied and both ended up with a RMSE of 68.3275. Two different models getting the same RMSE was a bit of a wake up call but the results were confirmed upon multile re-runs. It must be the case that 68.3275 is the best RMSE possible with the structure built in.\n\n\n\n\n\nA RMSE of 68.3275 is not a great result especially given that the majority of posts only have a score in the thousands. This leads us to believe that a model predicting the score is not feasible and that a state being mentioned does not have a tangible effect on the score.\n\n\n\nFurhter exploration could involve:\n\nAlternate Models: We could try out other machine learning models to see if we could get better results.\nImproved data cleaning: The data could be further cleaned through normalization and text editting which would improve results\nChange Target: While this is more of an expansion, changing the feature being targetted could allow for us to learn what we want through a different measure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo machine learning models, Random Forest Classifier and Logistic Regression, were implemented in PySpark to categorize product descriptions into predefined categories (main_category). The models used a text-processing pipeline, including tokenization, TF-IDF feature extraction, and classification. Their performance was evaluated on various metrics, including accuracy, F1-score, precision, and AUC-ROC scores for each class.\n\n\n\nRandom Forest Classifier achieved the best performance with following hyperparameters - Number of Features (HashingTF) : 50000 - Number of Trees : 100 - Max Depth : 5\nLogistic Regression achieved the best performance with the following hyperparameters - Number of Features (HashingTF) : 10000 - Regularization Parameter (RegParam) : 0.1\n\n\n\nComparison of ML Models\n\n\nBoth models achieve an AUC-ROC score greater than 0.5, indicating that they are capable of distinguishing between the categories of the subreddit with some level of reliability. However, the logistic regression model (AUC-ROC: 0.6739) performs better than the reinforcement model (AUC-ROC: 0.6251) in terms of distinguishing the classes in the main_category.\n\n\n\nCombine Random Forest and Logistic Regression for an ensemble model to leverage the strengths of both algorithms. Explore advanced NLP models like BERT or Transformer-based architectures for better semantic understanding.\n\n\n\n\nBy identifying the most common topic for each state, this analysis lays the groundwork for deeper investigations. Insights into Reddit conversations highlight the platform’s ability to capture real-world trends, opinions, and interests, making it a valuable source for understanding public discourse at a state level. Logistic Regression performs better in Accuracy, F1-Score, and AUC-ROC, making it the stronger model overall for predicting the subreddit based on the post."

    "text": "In this section, we dive into Natural Language Processing (NLP) to explore the themes and topics associated with different U.S. states on Reddit. Using techniques like PCA and TF-IDF, we can start identifying patterns and clustering states based on the keywords that frequently come up in discussions. This analysis gives us a deeper look at how people talk about each state, setting the stage for more detailed sentiment and topic analysis in the next milestones.\n\n\n\n\nThis analysis tracks the sentiment of Reddit discussions mentioning U.S. states over time. Sentiment scores, ranging from -1 (negative) to 1 (positive), are averaged for each state and visualized using a 14-day moving average. This approach highlights long-term sentiment trends while smoothing out short-term fluctuations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSentiment Scores: Sentiment analysis was applied to Reddit posts, generating scores for each post mentioning a state.\nDate Aggregation: Posts were grouped by date, and average sentiment scores were calculated for each state.\nSmoothing: A 14-day rolling mean was applied to smooth the data and highlight long-term trends.\n\n\n\n\n\nEach state is displayed in a separate panel, showing how sentiment changes over time.\nThe y-axis represents the average sentiment score, ranging from -1 (negative sentiment) to 1 (positive sentiment).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStates like Hawaii and Florida consistently exhibit positive sentiment, reflecting discussions related to travel and vacations.\nSeasonal spikes align with holidays and popular travel periods.\n\n\n\n\n\nStates such as Colorado and Indiana show relatively stable and neutral sentiment trends, indicating balanced or less emotionally charged discussions.\n\n\n\n\n\nStates like California and Texas show occasional dips into negative sentiment, often correlating with controversial topics or political discussions.\n\nHere we highlighted Louisiana and Maine because of notable sentiment shifts tied to significant events in each state. Let’s take a closer look: In Louisiana, a sharp rise in sentiment occurred in July 2024, coinciding with the state’s mandate requiring public classrooms to display the Ten Commandments. Meanwhile, in Maine, sentiment plummeted in October 2023 following mass shootings in Lewiston, where 22 people were killed, leading to a widespread manhunt. These examples illustrate how local events can strongly influence public sentiment over time.\n\n\n\nLouisiana and Maine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvent Overlay: Correlate sentiment trends with major events, such as elections, natural disasters, or cultural festivals.\nTopic Sentiment: Break down sentiment trends by topic (e.g., politics, tourism) for more nuanced insights.\nSubreddit Analysis: Examine how sentiment trends differ across various Reddit communities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith our dataset of all the comments that mentioned a full state name, we calculated a state-level average to generate the full rankings of all the states and territories. This analysis was performed using the Hugging Face twitter-dl sentiment analysis model and processed in a Spark job. Below is the total ranking of all the states and territories:\n\n\n\nSentiment by State Ranking\n\n\nAt the very top we have a few territories, American Samoaa and the Virgin Islands, which have high scores but are also not mentioned as often as the the states which leads to their ranks being not as significant. Same with DC, since we had to use the full names DC was mentioned the second to least and it seems that if people are writing out the full name of the city then they are fairly unhappy with it.\nOtherwise, Montana and New Mexico were some of the more popular states with Ohio, Florida, and Iowa being some of the least popular. Too look at the states more generally though lets visualize the whole country:\n\n\n\nSentiment by State Map\n\n\nWe can see here the more popular states from the less popular ones although the sentiment tended to swing positive, meaning that states were not seen very negatively in the aggregate. A few do stand out though, the ones mentioned as well as California, Maine, and even Arizona don’t seem to have the best impressions. There are not a ton of regional blocks, most states seem to have a varying opinions rather than being grouped by location.\nWith this sentiment average and ranking we decided to compare to the US News & World Report rankings which had an aggregate score and subgroups which the states were ranked by. We wanted to see if the sentiment that we found had any interaction with those results and if so which and how. We did compare them all together but it ended up looking like alot of noise. Why don’t you see for yourself:\n\n\n\n\n\nThis sentiment matrix visualizes how Reddit discussions about U.S. states vary across different subreddits. Each cell represents the sentiment score for a particular state mentioned within a specific subreddit, with sentiment scores ranging from -1 (negative) to 1 (positive).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubreddit Diversity: States like California and Texas exhibit diverse sentiment across subreddits, reflecting the variety of topics and emotional tones associated with these states.\nConsistent Sentiment: Smaller states such as Wyoming show more uniform sentiment across subreddits, indicating focused or limited discussions.\nPolarized Discussions: Subreddits addressing politically or culturally charged states often display strong variations in sentiment, highlighting their contentious nature.\nRegional Overlaps: States in the same geographic region (e.g., southern or northeastern states) may share sentiment trends across certain subreddits, possibly due to shared cultural or regional topics.\n\n\n\n\n\nSentiment Scoring: Sentiment was calculated for each Reddit post mentioning a state using an NLP sentiment analysis model. Scores were aggregated at the subreddit level for each state.\nData Normalization: Scores were rounded and normalized for clarity in the visualization.\nVisualization: A heatmap was created to display sentiment scores, with a diverging color scale to indicate positive, neutral, and negative sentiment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeep Dive into Subreddits: Investigate specific subreddits (e.g., politics, travel) to understand the drivers of sentiment for states like California and Florida.\nTemporal Analysis: Explore how sentiment across subreddits evolves over time, particularly for states with highly polarized discussions.\nTopic Alignment: Combine this analysis with topic modeling to identify dominant themes driving sentiment variations within subreddits.\n\n\n\n\nGif of Sentiment rank compared to State Rankings\n\n\nAcross all categories there did not seem to be any relationship between the sentiment average of a state and its ranking. This leads us to believe that the sentiment we are capturing is more around the vibes and feelings of a state which are more cultural and perspective driven than practical.\nOverall, we were able to look at a broad range of sentiment information around the states and found that these rankings were not tied to reality and thus may be more likely to shift to culutral rather than practical intervention.\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to looking at sentiment we wanted to look at word importance and hopefully importance by state. In order to do this we first attempted to use a TF-IDF model to ranking the different documents based on scores around subjects. While we were able to fit the model, we were unable to pull out relevant insights on an aggregate state by state level. In leiu of this though we went with the TF aspect of the model and compared those values. The wordcloud of the top 100 words can be seen below:\n\n\n\nWordcloud of the top 100 words\n\n\nThe top 5 words were one, people, new, also, and even in that order. We did remove stop words as a part of the process using pyspark’s StopWordsRemover() but most of what was left still wasn’t incredibly interesting and relevant. You can see a few states did have higher mentions like Texas, Florida, and California which all made it into the top 30. We did run this on state level subsets of the data but we ended up getting one as the topword for all of them and other familiar words to the overall list. We think that this is due to the size of the data and the differences between the values being too big for subsets to change it.\n\n\n\nIn this section, we demonstrated that sentiment can be pulled from reddit discussions to evaluate public opinions about states. This is evident given the drastic changes in sentiment that occurred in states like Maine and Louisiana during national, consuming news stories that drove discourse. Potential biases were more pronounced in this analysis, where we saw a territory like Washington DC exhibit extreme negative sentiment. Perhaps if other states were not contaminated with views and opinions about topics such as sports teams, a more accurate score of sentiment could be calculated. Finally, the sentiment being evaluated from these online discussions did not align with more traditional sources of state perception like state rankings on education, health, or economic performance. The sentiment of states in these posts more likely reflected topics like news, local culture, or the stochastic and ever-changing nature of public opinion. For future work, the sentiment of a state’s news could be compared to the sentiment of a state’s Reddit posts to examine similarities. In summary, while the sentiment we capture from Reddit is not traditional, it reflects a complicated phenomenon that could be useful in teasing out public opinion around marketing campaigns, state-level policy changes, or national events/news stories."

    "section": "",
    "text": "In Conclusion!\n\n\n\n\nThrough our project, we sought to figure out how online conversations reflect our perceptions of U.S. states. To facilitate this, we used two different subsets of Reddit data to first visualize and explore the relationships and information in the data itself before beginning a modeling process to answer our questions. This included natural language processing for sentiment analysis, training models to predict features, and exploring the context of text posts across the site. Afterwards, we broke down our results to find connections between online discourse and real-world problems, uncovering insights and identifying opportunities for growth.\n\n\nSome of the insights we would like to highlight are:\n\n\n\n\n\nSentiment by State Map\n\n\nThis sentiment map visualizes the average sentiment of posts mentioning each U.S. state, derived from the full Reddit data. The color scale ranges from blue (indicating more positive sentiment) to red (indicating more negative sentiment), with yellow representing neutral sentiment.\n\nBlue States: States like Montana and Maine show positive sentiment, suggesting discussions around these states are generally favorable.\nRed States: States like Kansas and Mississippi lean toward negative sentiment, indicating less favorable discussions in the dataset.\nNeutral States: Most states hover around neutral sentiment (yellow-green), reflecting a balance of positive and negative discussions.\n\nThis visualization highlights how public sentiment on Reddit varies across states, offering insights into regional perceptions and how discussions align with or diverge from real-world reputations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLouisiana and Maine Mentions\n\n\nThis chart visualizes the daily mentions of Louisiana and Maine, normalized using Z-scores and smoothed over a 7-day rolling average. Key spikes in mentions correspond to major events:\n\nLouisiana: In July 2024, a sharp increase in mentions occurred when the state mandated the display of the Ten Commandments in public classrooms.\nMaine: In October 2023, mentions peaked dramatically during the manhunt in Lewiston after mass shootings that tragically claimed 22 lives.\n\nThese spikes underline the strong correlation between major state-specific events and public discourse, as captured through Reddit data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLouisiana and Maine Mentions\n\n\nThe comparative chart highlights how public attention varies between states:\n\nLouisiana’s mentions feature a distinct, isolated peak tied to its event.\nMaine’s mentions display a more prolonged period of heightened activity, reflecting extended discussions surrounding the tragic events in Lewiston.\n\nThese stood out to us as some of the more interesting results from our analysis. While there is always more to uncover, we are excited to share these findings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile we have made significant progress on this subject, there are additional steps we could take to further explore our questions and obtain more accurate results:\n\nAddress issues in the data caused by our regex search, which left some out-of-context words. Instead, we could use a context-specific model to focus on mentions where people are specifically talking about the state.\nExperiment with other sentiment models to observe if there are noticeable changes in state sentiment rankings.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen we first started this project, we hoped to return a spatial (and special) element to the data, and we were successful in doing so while analyzing U.S. states. While this was our primary focus, we also see possibilities for applying our methods to other spatial aspects of the data, such as regions, countries, oceans, and other geographic entities.\nOur work demonstrates that sentiments often do not relate to the realities of a location but are instead based more on reputation. This insight could be the start of organizations tracking their popularity through looser metrics that are not bound to traditional methods. We hope that organizations explore this further in the future, and we also hope that the work we’ve done sets the stage for others to continue in a similar direction."

    "text": "In this project, our group (Isfar Baset, Powell Sheagren, Ronan Corgel, Sai Prerana Mandalika) aims to investigate public sentiment and discussion frequency about U.S. states on Reddit. Due to the limited geographic data on Reddit, we focus on identifying state mentions and analyzing sentiment, keywords, and predictive patterns related to each state. This analysis will provide insights into whether online sentiment correlates with real-life state rankings and perceptions."

    "text": "Our group decided to tackle the topic with two different cuts of Reddit data. We started with the cleaned Reddit data provided to the class, which included submissions and posts from June 2023 to July 2024.\nTo create the first cut of data, we selected specific subreddits where we believed states would be mentioned and opinions about states discussed. We limited the data to the following subreddits: r/Travel, r/AskAnAmerican, r/USATravel, as well as the 50 individual state subreddits (e.g., r/NewYork, r/California, r/Ohio). From these subreddits, we further filtered the data to include only submissions and comments where full state names were mentioned. This dataset (referred to as the Subreddit Data) contained over 120,000 submissions and posts where full state names were mentioned.\nThe second cut of data took a simpler and more universal approach. From the full dataset, we filtered for comments containing full state names. We decided to focus on comments, as they are more likely to contain opinions about states. After cleaning, this dataset (referred to as the Full Data) contained over 28 million comments mentioning full state names.\nA potential data issue is the use of full state names. Posts regarding notable figures like George Washington or sports teams such as the New York Yankees may introduce noise into our analysis. This issue is discussed further in the Summary section.\n\n\n\nData Collection Overview"

In order to do this we first attempted to use a TF-IDF model to ranking the different documents based on scores around subjects. While we were able to fit the model, we were unable to pull out relevant insights on an aggregate state by state level. In leiu of this though we went with the TF aspect of the model and compared those values. The wordcloud of the top 100 words can be seen below:\n\n\n\nWordcloud of the top 100 words\n\n\nThe top 5 words were one, people, new, also, and even in that order. We did remove stop words as a part of the process using pyspark’s StopWordsRemover() but most of what was left still wasn’t incredibly interesting and relevant. You can see a few states did have higher mentions like Texas, Florida, and California which all made it into the top 30. We did run this on state level subsets of the data but we ended up getting one as the topword for all of them and other familiar words to the overall list. We think that this is due to the size of the data and the differences between the values being too big for subsets to change it."

The goal of this was to determine if the presence of certain states were able to predict the score of a post, which is a stand in for the popularity.\n\n\n\nBoth a linear regression and random forest model were applied and both ended up with a RMSE of 68.3275.

This included natural language processing for sentiment analysis, training models to predict features, and exploring the context of text posts across the site. Afterwards, we broke down our results to find connections between online discourse and real-world problems, uncovering insights and identifying opportunities for growth.\n\n\nSome of the insights we would like to highlight are:\n\n\n\n\n\nSentiment by State Map\n\n\nThis sentiment map visualizes the average sentiment of posts mentioning each U.S. state, derived from the full Reddit data. The color scale ranges from blue (indicating more positive sentiment) to red (indicating more negative sentiment), with yellow representing neutral sentiment.\n\nBlue States: States like Montana and Maine show positive sentiment, suggesting discussions around these states are generally favorable.\nRed States: States like Kansas and Mississippi lean toward negative sentiment, indicating less favorable discussions in the dataset.\nNeutral States: Most states hover around neutral sentiment (yellow-green), reflecting a balance of positive and negative discussions.\n\nThis visualization highlights how public sentiment on Reddit varies across states, offering insights into regional perceptions and how discussions align with or diverge from real-world reputations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLouisiana and Maine Mentions\n\n\nThis chart visualizes the daily mentions of Louisiana and Maine, normalized using Z-scores and smoothed over a 7-day rolling average. Key spikes in mentions correspond to major events:\n\nLouisiana: In July 2024, a sharp increase in mentions occurred when the state mandated the display of the Ten Commandments in public classrooms.\nMaine: In October 2023, mentions peaked dramatically during the manhunt in Lewiston after mass shootings that tragically claimed 22 lives.\n\nThese spikes underline the strong correlation between major state-specific events and public discourse, as captured through Reddit data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLouisiana and Maine Mentions\n\n\nThe comparative chart highlights how public attention varies between states:\n\nLouisiana’s mentions feature a distinct, isolated peak tied to its event.\nMaine’s mentions display a more prolonged period of heightened activity, reflecting extended discussions surrounding the tragic events in Lewiston.\n\nThese stood out to us as some of the more interesting results from our analysis. While there is always more to uncover, we are excited to share these findings."

    "text": "In this section, we demonstrated that sentiment can be pulled from reddit discussions to evaluate public opinions about states. This is evident given the drastic changes in sentiment that occurred in states like Maine and Louisiana during national, consuming news stories that drove discourse. Potential biases were more pronounced in this analysis, where we saw a territory like Washington DC exhibit extreme negative sentiment. Perhaps if other states were not contaminated with views and opinions about topics such as sports teams, a more accurate score of sentiment could be calculated. Finally, the sentiment being evaluated from these online discussions did not align with more traditional sources of state perception like state rankings on education, health, or economic performance. The sentiment of states in these posts more likely reflected topics like news, local culture, or the stochastic and ever-changing nature of public opinion. For future work, the sentiment of a state’s news could be compared to the sentiment of a state’s Reddit posts to examine similarities. In summary, while the sentiment we capture from Reddit is not traditional, it reflects a complicated phenomenon that could be useful in teasing out public opinion around marketing campaigns, state-level policy changes, or national events/news stories."
